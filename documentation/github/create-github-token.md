4. Configure the Token:

    Give your token a descriptive name to remember what it's used for (for example, "My Access Token for CI/CD").

    Set an expiration date: You can choose to have the token expire after a set period (like 30, 60, or 90 days), or never expire.

    Select scopes/permissions: Choose what your token will be able to do.
